# in python, the entire file is basically a main function; i.e. if you have something outside of a method, it will run whenever you import that file, i.e.:
# print("Hello Hi Hola all"); # this line will execute whenever you import this file, regardless of if you called it or not.

# in order to only run certain snippets of code, we must encapsulate them and call them directly via their method name
